# Examples of React Hooks 

I'm currently working through [this LinkedIn Learning workshop](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/react-hooks) on React Hooks and trying out everything I learn in this repository. 

Feel free to use as examples of React hooks and the easy interaction they bring.

This technology is really a nice improvement over the older class syntax which I originally learned with React. It's worth staying up to date! :thumbsup:

## Setup

This is based on a **create-react-app** so just:

- `git clone https://github.com/edwardtanguay/reacthooks222`
- `npm i`
- `npm start`

and you're good to go! :grinning:
